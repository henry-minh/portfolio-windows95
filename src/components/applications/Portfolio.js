        <h4>A Study on Usable Security and Online Scalping Bots</h4>
        <p>
          This project was developed in collaboration with{" "}
          <a
            href="https://carleton.ca/scs/people/jean-pierre-corriveau/"

          (Carleton University) for my fourth year Honours project.
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal is to showcase how denial of inventory attacks (Scalping
          attacks) negatively impact online businesses by developing a tool that
          can simulate mass users attempting to purchase products online. The
          inability to distribute highly limited inventory appropriately can
          annoy consumers and result in a reduction in customer retention and
          possible future revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          I developed a functioning automated checkout bot that can concurrently
          simulate multiple customers purchasing high demand products on web
          platforms powered by Shopify.
        </p>
        <p>
          The three main security measures implemented on Shopify includes a web
          application firewall, queue state, and bot protection. The software
          developed evaluates the purpose and effectiveness of each of these
          components from a usable security perspective while proposing
          alternative solutions.

        <h4>QNX Neutrino: Real-Time Warehouse Ordering System</h4>
        <p>
          QNX Neutrino is a Real Time Operating System developed by Blackberry
          and is commonly used in low level programming. Examples include IOT
          devices, autonomous vehicles, and sensors in a distributed system.
          This project focuses on how multiple threads need to be scheduled when
          accessing a shared data structure for an online warehouse ordering
          system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thousands of simulated clients send mass orders to a warehouse server.
          The server (Running on QNX Neutrino) confirms and fulfill orders in
          the warehouse while maintaining data integrity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inventory data integrity is handled by preventing multiple threads
          performing transactions on the same resources simultaneously. This is
          done by implementing mutexes and giving each server thread a unique
          round-robin scheduling priority algorithm based on the client orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a project where I collaborated with my university peers:
          Brandon Atkins, Tristan Demers, and Chris Boyd.
